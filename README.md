# Road Accident Severity Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project applies **Linear Regression** to analyze and predict the **severity of road accidents** based on several influencing factors.  
The work demonstrates the practical use of supervised learning in data-driven decision-making, particularly for traffic safety management in underdeveloped countries.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the notebook or `.pkl` file in Google Colab.  
2. Load the dataset from the provided Google Drive link.  
3. Run all code cells sequentially.  
4. Review the screenshots for reference on each stepâ€™s output.  

Example of loading the dataset:
```python
import pandas as pd
url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=120dfP-s9BPJhI5dtPiv75eMJWUqL6Sc0'
data = pd.read_csv(url)
data.head()
